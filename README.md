memory_limit = 512M
post_max_size = 256M

#### Google API Key (Maps, etc.)

You'll need a Google API Key if you plan to use any of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, such as geolocation, etc.

In the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard), select (or create) your project, then go to APIs, and then Credentials. Add an API Key here and then go to the Library tab. From here, find the Geocoding API and enable it for your API Key. Then set the API Key in the .env:
```ini
GOOGLECLOUDPLATFORM_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

#### Google Drive OAuth Client Keys

In the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard), you'll need to setup an OAuth consent screen and a Credential.

The Client ID Credential that you setup needs to be scoped for `Google_Service_Drive::DRIVE` (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`).

Once you've created the credential / access token, save them and add them to the .env:
```ini
GOOGLEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
GOOGLEDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
```

#### Flickr API Key

You'll also need to create [Flickr API Keys](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/). Once you've created your keys, set them in the .env:
```ini
FLICKR_CONSUMER_KEY=<your-api-key>
FLICKR_CONSUMER_SECRET_KEY=<your-api-secret>
```
